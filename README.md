Aims
-----
* A TDD-ed Rails app
* To learn how to write RSpec tests for Rails that also utilize FactoryGirl and Capybara

Learning Materials
----
* Rails Tutorial
    * [Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial - 3rd edition](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/_single-page)
    * [Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial - 2nd edition.](http://rails-4-0.railstutorial.org/book/_single-page)
        * Note: I used the 2nd edition to learn about RSpec. However, since the RSpec used is outdated, I used other websites to self-learn the latest RSpec.
* RSpec
